<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Pratai provides an incredibly flexible and resilient platform to migrate
workloads to the cloud that respond to events without having to manage any
server or network.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<p>The goal of Pratai is simple. Deploy &ldquo;code&rdquo; (disclaimer, from now on I
will refer to code as functions), that will react to an event without
worrying about anything else, the platform handles the execution. Simple right?</p>

<p>In order to achieve that, first, we need to deploy a function in a <code>zip</code> format
for one of the languages that the platform supports,
the first one is python but more will be added in the future, after this a
docker image gets created with the custom
function and the requirements. e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># new_module.py
import numpy  # yes you can install dependencies, just send a requirements.txt


def local_function(payload):
    # you can create local functions
    return payload


def main(payload=None):
    # a main function should always be declared
    # and using a payload as a parameter
    return local_function(payload)
</code></pre>

<p>When a function gets created it will remain as inactive, waiting to be executed
whenever an event happens that the function is subscribed to, could be a webhook
endpoint, which can be assigned at creation time, or a message in a queue but
basically, every event will spawn a container that will execute the event and
then disappear.</p>

<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>

<p>Pratai is conformed of 2 major pieces, the Control Plane and the Nodes.</p>

<h4 id="control-plane">Control Plane</h4>

<p>An API gateway, a database cluster and a load balancer, and agent and a scheduler
runs in the control plane.</p>

<p>For the first version a API gateway built in python using flask will be made,
in the future I think Golang should be a better option for it.</p>

<p>An elasticsearch cluster will power the storage of events, function metadata
and cluster information.</p>

<p>And a nginx load balancer will connect 3 instances to the API in a <code>least_connect</code>
manner.</p>

<h4 id="pratai-nodes">Pratai Nodes</h4>

<p>A Pratai node is composed by a driver and runtimes.</p>

<p>When a new node is created it will automatically connect to the cluster and it
will start polling for events.</p>

<p>A driver is basically a container orchestrator like swarm, kubernetes, plain
docker, etc. in this case we will use docker.</p>

<p>The runtimes are the languages supported by the platform, they are a base
container image that contains an OS, a language and its dependencies, etc. that
can be used by the functions the users submits. e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># seed/Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:14.04
RUN apt-get -y update
RUN apt-get install -y git unzip wget
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># python27/Dockerfile

FROM pratai/seed:latest

RUN apt-get install -y python python-dev python-setuptools python-pip
RUN pip install pip --upgrade
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># python27_template.txt
FROM pratai/python27:latest
RUN wget {zip_location}
RUN unzip {zip_file}
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
RUN mkdir /etc/pratai/
RUN mkdir /var/log/pratai/
RUN cp new_module.py /etc/pratai/
RUN git clone &quot;repo_with_runtimes&quot;
CMD [&quot;python&quot;, &quot;/pratai-runtimes/runtimes/python27/server.py&quot;]
</code></pre>

<h4 id="distributed-queues">Distributed Queues</h4>

<p>ZeroMQ is the choice for queuing and passing messages in pratai using the PUSH/PULL
architecture we can create a pipelines of messages that can be distributed
across multiple nodes.</p>

<p>We will have a producer and a collector running in the scheduler, and consumers
running in the Pratai nodes, one consumer should be spawned per thread.</p>

<h3 id="events">Events</h3>

<p>A function can react to any event coming through webhooks or messages
in a queue, even events that happen in a database can trigger a function, is
important to notice that a response of a function is an event, so it can trigger
so chaining functions to build pipelines of data processing is easy with Pratai.</p>

<p>There are 2 kinds of events, <code>async</code> and <code>wait_for_response</code></p>

<h4 id="async">Async</h4>

<p>This is the default event for pratai, it will take a request or a message and
process it asynchronously, then, you can collect the logs or responses,
by default the response gets stored in a collector queue, that can send this
response as an input for other functions.</p>

<p>You can use the async event in the following cases:</p>

<p>1: Async + Webhook</p>

<p>This is the default behaviour, in which a function will be executed
asynchronously when an HTTP POST requests hits its endpoint.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">pratai function-create {name} --type async --event webhook
</code></pre>

<p>2: Async + Message</p>

<p>A function created with this configuration will executed asynchronously when a
message arrives in the event queues available for the platform.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">pratai function-create {name} --type async --event message --subscribe_to {event_id}
</code></pre>

<p>3: Async + Timer</p>

<p>A function created with this configuration will executed asynchronously
every time a timer sends an event, the frequency of the events are set in minutes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">pratai function-create {name} --type async --event timer --frequency 5
</code></pre>

<h4 id="wait-for-response">Wait For Response</h4>

<p>This is a request that works like a typical web server, you send a request and
you wait for a response and only works for webhooks events</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">pratai function-create {name} --type wait_for_response --event webhook
</code></pre>

<h3 id="components">Components</h3>

<h4 id="api-gateway">API Gateway</h4>

<p>The API is the main interface for incoming webhook requests and for platform
configuration.</p>

<h4 id="agent">Agent</h4>

<p>The Agent is the main interface for events in queues and cron jobs.</p>

<h4 id="client">client</h4>

<p>python-prataiclient is the component that allows the user to interact with the
api from the command line interface, with it you can do stuff like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">pratai function-create music_tag --file /path/to/zip --description \
    &quot;extract metadata from music files&quot; --memory 128

pratai function-list
</code></pre>

<p>Because this is OpenStack you should pass credentials to interact with the
platform</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">export OS_USERNAME=user
export OS_PASSWORD=password
export OS_TENANT_NAME=pratai_tenant
export OS_PRATAI_URL=http://192.168.33.9:9096
export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
export OS_AUTH_URL=http://192.168.33.9:5000/v3
export OS_PROJECT_NAME=pratai_tenant
export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
</code></pre>

<h4 id="drivers">Drivers</h4>

<p>A driver is a backend that orchestrate a container that contains the custom code.</p>

<h4 id="runtimes">Runtimes</h4>

<p>A runtime is a language that is supported by the platform, it contains the
language and its dependencies.</p>

<h4 id="scheduler">Scheduler</h4>

<p>The scheduler primarily consists of a set of Python daemons, though it requires
and integrates with a number of native system components for databases and
messaging capabilities.</p>

<p>1; Scheduler</p>

<p>The API and the Agent push messages to this queue which will be pre-processed
before being distributed among the pratai nodes.</p>

<p>2; Collector</p>

<p>When a function finish the function execution it will send the result and
status here in order to be stored in the database afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="security-secrets">Security &amp; Secrets</h3>

<p>The functions that interact with external services most often that not they
require to use credentials to connect, for this, Barbican has been proposed to
help with this scenario.</p>

<p>We definitely recommend using tokens instead of user/passwords when possible.</p>
