Concurrent learning is a model of studying that relies on several approaches to learning faster and deeper several topics.

One way of visualizing this is by separating domains into interconnected graphs making it easier to connect fundamental topics and ideas that can be leveraged across multiple domains.

## How to use it

By relying on the **first principle thinking** you can clarify complicated ideas or problems by separating them into its most fundamental parts and start reasoning from there, what remains are the bare essentials that can be tackled individually and reduce them to absurdity. It helps a lot to visualize them as a graph of knowledge.

Once youâ€™ve identified them, you can approach them using another mental model called **divide and conquer**. At this point, the topic can be described as a collection of ideas or facts that can be applied to other topics or domains by applying the **knowledge transfer** model.

With these essentials ideas identify them, you can start understanding them individually by using one technique called **Feynman technique**

1. Write the name of the concept at the top of a blank piece of paper.
2. Write down an explanation of the concept on the page. Use plain English. Pretend you are teaching it to someone else (e.g a new student). This should highlight what you understand, but more importantly, pinpoint what you don't quite know.
3. Review what you have pinpointed you don't know. Go back to the source material, re-read, and re-learn it. Repeat Step 2.
4. If you are using overly wordy or confusing language (or simply paraphrasing the source material) try again so you filter the content. Simplify your language, and where possible use a simple analogy.

By the end, you will have a graph of knowledge that:

1. You understand
2. Easy to reason to its fundamental parts
3. You can apply to other domains (or not)
4. You can share and teach to others
