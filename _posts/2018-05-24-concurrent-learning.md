Concurrent learning is a studying model that relies on several techniques to learn and understand several subjects at once.

One way of visualising this is by separating domains into interconnected graphs making it easier to link fundamental topics or statements that can be shared across multiple areas.

## Overview

By relying on the [first principle thinking](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/) you can clarify complicated ideas or problems by separating them into its most fundamental parts and start reasoning from there, what remains are the bare essentials that we can tackle individually.

It helps a lot to visualise them as a graph as well.

Once youâ€™ve identified them, you can approach them using another mental model called [divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm) which will help you to separate the ideas or problems into smaller parts.

TODO: (Add example)

At this point, you can apply them to other subjects or areas using the [knowledge transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_transfer) model in which you can apply ideas from one subject to another.

With these essential ideas identified, you can start understanding them individually using one technique called [Feynman technique](https://curiosity.com/topics/learn-anything-in-four-steps-with-the-feynman-technique-curiosity/) which is described as follows:

    1. Write the name of the concept at the top of a blank piece of paper.
    2. Write down an explanation of the concept on the page. Use plain English (or any language). Pretend you are teaching it to someone else (e.g a new student). This should highlight what you understand, but more importantly, pinpoint what you don't quite understand. (Circle of competence)
    3. Review what you have pinpointed you don't know. Go back to the source material, re-read, and re-learn it. Repeat Step 2.
    4. If you are using overly wordy or confusing language (or simply paraphrasing the source material) try again so you filter the content. Simplify your language, and where possible use a simple analogy.

At the end, you will have a graph of knowledge that:

    1. You understand,
    2. Is easy to reason to its fundamental parts,
    3. You can apply to other domains,
    4. You can share and teach to others.
